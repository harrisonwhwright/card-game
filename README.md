# card-game

TASK:
Create a card game for two players.
The game uses a deck of cards. There are 30 cards in a deck.
Each card has one colour (red, black or yellow).
Each card has a number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) for each colour.
Each card is unique.

The 30 cards are shuffled and stored in the deck.

The rules are:
- Player 1 takes the top card from the deck.
- Player 2 takes the next card from the deck.
- If both players have a card of the same colour, the player with the highest number wins.
- If both players have cards with different colours, the winning colour is determinded by: RED BEATS BLACK, BLACK BEATS YELLOW, YELLOW BEATS RED.
- The winner of each round keeps both cards.
- The players keep playing until there are no cards left in the deck.

Things to consider:
- Only authorised players are allowed to play the game.
- Where appropriate, input from the user should be validated.

Additionally, I will need to produce a document for this task that includes:
- Design work
    - Written description of the system in my own words
    - Hierarchy chart
    - overall game flowchart
    - Pseudocode for the processes
    - Function and variable listing
    - HCl rationale and annotated front end designs
- Code
    - Code listings with clearly commented code
- Testing
    - Well thought out test plan aiming to destructively test my code.
